## Make progress, not noise

Think carefully about the way you handle communication in the project — make sure it is useful, and that it doesn’t make other contributors jobs harder. Submitting pull requests to fix issues is great, but are they truly useful, and easy to review? Filing issues and joining in other conversations is fine, but are your issues and comments on topic, or are they just adding noise?

As a rule, do:

- Use [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions) before filing an issue. This helps to keep issues focused and productive.
- Ask questions using other mechanisms like [chat rooms](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org) or [forums](<(https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/236)>) if you are not sure whether something is useful or have a simple question.
- Read the [contributor documentation]() and [how to write documentation]() first to try to solve the issue yourself.

Don’t:

- Complicate issues by trying to discuss multiple topics at once, or making off-topic comments.
- Open lots of issues asking vague questions.
- Ask questions without trying to solve the problem yourself first.

## Working on an issue

All repositories have an issue tracker, where you can find tasks to help contribute

Most repositories have a `help-wanted` label or `good-first-issue` label. Some do not, but this is not a pre-requisite and you are welcome to browse and pick something that is suitable for your skill set.

Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, amke sure no one else is assigned to the issue. Add a comment saying you would like to work on it and assign the issue to yourself.

Most issues need some investigation before work can start, if you need to ask questions

_(define)_

If you take on an issue we expect work to happen in a timely manner. If you can no longer take on the task, leave a comment and unassign yourself.

Fork and branch the repository, do your work and open a [pull request](linktopullrequest).

_(more stuff)_

Now and then, you may run into problems while using MDN. Whether it's a problem with site infrastructure or an error in documentation content, you can either try to fix it yourself or report the problem. While the former is preferred, the latter is sometimes the best you can manage, and that's okay too.

The best thing you can possibly do is fix problems you spot yourself — this is done by updating the site source:

- The MDN content itself is found in the [content](https://github.com/mdn/content) repo.
- The MDN platform code, which renders the content as MDN, is found in the [yari](https://github.com/mdn/yari) repo.

Both repos include useful information to guide you on how to contribute.

However, maybe you don't know the answer or are in the middle of a deadline on your own project, and need to jot down the problem so someone can look at it later.

The way to report a documentation problem by filing an [documentation issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues) or [platform issue](https://github.com/mdn/yari/issues), depending on what the problem you've discovered relates to.
