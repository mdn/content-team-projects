# Copyright and licensing

MDN Web Docs is an evolving learning platform for Web technologies and the software that powers the Web, including [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript). We also have a detailed set of beginner's learning material — see [Learn Web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn).

## Using MDN Web Docs content

MDN's content is available free of charge under open source licenses. This section covers the types of content we provide and what licenses are in effect for each.

### Documentation and articles

> **Note:** MDN content has been prepared with the contributions of authors from both inside and outside Mozilla. Unless otherwise indicated, the content is available under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) (CC-BY-SA), v2.5, or any later version.

When reusing MDN content, you need to ensure two things:

1. Attribution is given to the original content.

Please attribute "Mozilla Contributors" and include a hyperlink (online) or URL (in print) to the specific page for the content being sourced. For example, you can write:

> [CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) by [Mozilla Contributors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contributors.txt) is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).

Note that in the example, "Mozilla Contributors" links to the history of the cited page. See [Best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking/Users) for further explanation.

2. Your reuse is published under the same license as the original content — CC-BY-SA v2.5 or any later version.

### Code samples and snippets

Code samples added on or after August 20, 2010 are in the [public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)). No licensing notice is necessary, but if you need one, you can use: "Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain. http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/".

Code samples added before August 20, 2010, are available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

Since the new MDN Web Docs platform launched on December 14, 2020, there is no way to determine which one you need. However, we are working on this and will update this content soon.

### Contributions

When contributing, you must make your contributions available under the Attribution-ShareAlike license (or an alternative license already specified by the page you are editing). In addition, code samples are available under [Creative Commons CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (a Public Domain dedication). By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be available under those licenses.

> **NOTE:** No new pages may be created using a license other than CC-BY-SA v2.5.

**Copyright for contributed materials remains with the author unless the author assigns it to someone else**.

If you have any questions or concerns about anything discussed here, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions/categories/content) and let us know.
