# Getting Started

MDN Web Docs needs your help. This page outlines what you can do to help.

> **Note:** If you haven't contributed to MDN previously, the [Getting Started](general/index.md) guide explains the process in four simple steps. Good news, you're already on step 2: "Picking a task to complete."!

## What can I do to help?

There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skillset and interests. Along with each task we provide a short description and an approximate time that each type of task typically takes.

If you are not sure what to do, you are always welcome to [ask for help](general/index.md#step_4_ask_for_help).

## Primary contribution types

The links in this section lead to detailed guides explaining how to do a particular contribution task that we are most interested in getting community help with, either because they are a critical function, and/or because they have a large backlog associated with them. Please consider helping out with these tasks before you consider contributing in other ways.

### Fixing content bugs

Our [content repo](https://github.com/mdn/content/) is where people [submit issues](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues) to report problems found with MDN docs. We get a lot of content bugs, and any help you can give in fixing them would be much appreciated.

#### Skillset required

- Basic knowledge of using [Git and GitHub](../getting-started/git-github-beginners/index.md).
- Knowledge of the web technologies you choose to help with (e.g JavaScript, CSS).
- A reasonable understanding of the English language (don’t worry if your English is not perfect; we can help you with it).

### Reviewing content pull requests

People submit pull requests on our content repo all the time to update MDN content, and we need help reviewing them. Read our pull request review guide to find out how the reviewing process works, and how you can get involved.
